"Complete" progressive-rock inspired theme for LeftWM. Epitaph is being developed as a starting point
for Gnu/Linux :penguin: users who are transitioning from a complete Desktop Environment to a great WM, this theme does not
aim to be "simple" or "minimalistic", it aims to be complete and user friendly as I can make it.

Suggestions, ideas or requests are always welcome, feel free to open an issue.

## News :newspaper:

**EPITAPH IS BACK ON TRACK! (2023)**

As of February 2023 I've resumed the development of Epitaph to further expand the LeftWM community (or just get progressive rock / metal lovers into window-managers).

I'm trasitioning this theme to use some "new" features I had in mind. Please be patient here are some of the few *new* features you can expect in the next commits:

- Improvements to liquid template for lemonbar.
- Improved wiki.
- New GitHub thumbnail.
- Improve epitaph installation script.
- Improvements on battery-notify and battery programs in Rust.

## Installation

Installation instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/VentGrey/Epitaph/wiki)

- Very tiny rust power manager
- An integrated script for wallpaper slideshows

# Easy Polybar / Lemonbar switching!

**:warning: This feature is to be deprecated soon.**

If you are concerned with the code of the deprecated modules, I keep a copy at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/VentGrey/debdotfiles) repository or you can visit my [blog](https://ventgrey.github.io) to learn how to setup your own lemonbar from scratch.
