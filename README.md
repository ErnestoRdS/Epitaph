"Complete" progressive-rock inspired theme for LeftWM. Epitaph is being developed as a starting point
for Gnu/Linux :penguin: users who are transitioning from a complete Desktop Environment to a great WM, this theme does not
aim to be "simple" or "minimalistic", it aims to be complete and user friendly as I can make it.

Suggestions, ideas or requests are always welcome, feel free to open an issue.
