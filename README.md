# Epitaph

*Version: 0.8.2 - "If we make it, we can all sit back and laugh."*

> Confusion, will be my epitaph...ðŸŽ¶ 

Complete theme for LeftWM. Epitaph is being developed as a starting point
for Gnu/Linux :penguin: users who are transitioning from a complete Desktop Environment to a minimalist WM, this theme does not
aim to be "simple" or "minimalistic", it aims to be complete and new-ser friendly while keeping 
modularity at first.

## News :newspaper:

**Epitaph is preparing itself for a big release including new features, wallpapers, installer
and much more sweets for it's users! This version is just a "taste" of what the future of Epitaph is and how it will work.**

- Improved polybar icons for CPU and RAM
- Applist dmenu script is now case insensitive (it works better with fuzzy search patch)
- Improved the manpage dmenu script look and feel (just added a book emoji)
- Deleted the emacs daemon init from the `up` script
- Deleted the light command from the `battery-notify` script
- [WIP] Improved the recommended applist in the `install script`
- Added a manpage for documenting Epitaph scripts. 

## Overview

This configuration includes:
- POSIX shell `up` and `down` scripts for fast loading / reloading times
- Simple animations on windows powered by picom
- A simple `dmenu` application menu with icons
- Compact workspaces
- Polybar indicators for:
  - CPU use percentage
  - Memory use in GiB
  - Calendar + Hour in a simple format
  - Battery / AC Adapter indicator
  - Pulseaudio indicator
  - Spotify music indicator

- Doom One colorscheme (Taken from DT's [xmobar config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dtos-configs/-/blob/main/etc/skel/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc))
- Very tiny POSIX Shell power manager
- An integrated script for wallpaper slideshows

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of how this will look on your machine (Screenshots are outdated but the theme hasn't changed much)

## Rationale
Window Managers are awesome (no pun intended) by design, and being well configured they can be as good (or better) as a Desktop Environment, however, setup and ricing takes time...a **LOT** of time. Being a new WM user myself I'm writing this configuration to help transitioning users get a better experience when they
take their first steps in here.

As stated before, this config's main goal is **NOT** to be minimal, it is to be modular while being complete for new users, as their (mine) experience increases with this environment they should be able to trim down these files at their liking.

*But, why xDE tools?* you ask.

Simple, some other tools are a hell-like experience to configure, also editing dotfiles like a madman only helps by adding fuel to this hell, so LXDE / XFCE tools are lightweight, UNIX compliant and do one thing and do it well, of course I can add alternatives or change those tools over time given the right arguments to do so.

## Installation:

### Check for dependencies and compatibility + Compile rust goodies

You should run the `install` script, mind that it **WON'T**  install anything, we have `leftwm-theme` for that. This script will check if you have all the correct dependencies in order to install this theme.

### NO! I'm too lazy, do it for me! >.<

You can install using the official `leftwm-theme` tool.

`leftwm-theme install "Epitaph"`

**BUT** bear in mind that this won't work as expected since it is not possible to make "post-install hooks" in `leftwm-theme`, you'll have to do extra-work by yourself.

### Manual Installation (If you want the latest git commit)

This theme installation is pretty straightforward:

Extract this repository to `~/.config/leftwm/themes`

- Either rename it as `current` or create a symlink called `current` it to the above folder

- Soft reload with:  <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

If everything is good, this theme should load up quickly if not, please check your dependencies. Feel free
to open requests, make suggestions and improvements, try not to get confused.

## Issues (Not worth using the tabs up there)
- Nothing for now
