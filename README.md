# Epitaph

*Version: 0.5.2 - "Moonchild"*

> Confusion, will be my epitaph...ðŸŽ¶ 

Complete theme for LeftWM. Epitaph is being developed as a starting point
for Loonex :penguin: users who are transitioning from a complete Desktop Environment to a minimalist WM, this theme does not
aim to be "simple" or "minimalistic", it aims to be complete and new-ser friendly while keeping 
modularity at first.

## News :newspaper:
- I've dropped `rofi` completely for `dmenu` which is simpler and powerful enough to get customization.
- dmenu scripts come with an application launcher for common programs + flatpaks
- the powermenu that polybar invoked has been rewritten to use dmenu
- Polybar spacing has been improved

You can find my personal config in the `config.toml` file

This configuration includes:
- POSIX shell `up` and `down` scripts for fast loading / reloading times
- Simple animations on windows powered by picom
- A simple `dmenu` application menu with icons
- Compact workspaces
- Polybar indicators for:
  - CPU use percentage
  - Memory use in GiB
  - Calendar + Hour in a simple format
  - Battery / AC Adapter indicator
  - Pulseaudio indicator
  - Spotify music indicator
  - Systray
- Doom One colorscheme (Taken from DT's [xmobar config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dtos-configs/-/blob/main/etc/skel/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc))
- Very tiny POSIX Shell power manager
- An integrated script for wallpaper slideshows

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of how this will look on your machine (Screenshots are outdated but the theme hasn't changed much)

### Vanilla look

## Rationale
Window Managers are awesome (no pun intended) by design, and being well configured they can be as good (or better) as a Desktop Environment, however, setup and ricing takes time...a **LOT** of time. Being a new WM user myself I'm writing this configuration to help transitioning users get a better experience when they
take their first steps in here.

As stated before, this config's main goal is **NOT** to be minimal, it is to be modular while being complete for new users, as their (mine) experience increases with this environment they should be able to trim down these files at their liking.

*But, why XFCE / LXDE tools?* you ask.

Simple, some other tools are a hell-like experience to configure, also editing dotfiles like a madman only helps by adding fuel to this hell, so LXDE / XFCE tools are lightweight, UNIX compliant and do one thing and do it well, of course I can add alternatives or change those tools over time given the right arguments to do so.


## Prerequisites / Dependencies 
This theme needs the following dependencies to work properly:

- `leftwm` (duh)
- `polybar`(Status bar written in very unsafe rust...or very safe C++)
- `dmenu` (rofi for people who don't like rofi)
- `picom (THE STABLE ONE!)` (Nice blur, shadow and transparency effects brought to you by the gazillionth fork of a composter)
- [OPTIONAL]`compton` (Just in case picom doesn't work, we can always fall back to the ugly one)
- `feh` (Simple tool for an awesome wallpaper)
- `xdg-user-dirs-gtk` (Keep your home folders in your home language)
- `mate-polkit` or `mate-polkit-bin` (Manage privileges with the grace of MATE)
- `gnome-keyring-daemon` (Save secrets, ssh keys and NASA hacking passwords)
- `apparmor + aa-notify` (Userspace security made usabe by the user in it's space)
- `lxapperance` (Just for more theming thingies)
- `blueman` (We need a bluetooth applet)
- `nm-applet` (The good old systray applet, nothing beats it)
- `notify-send` (We need this to report errors to you!)
- `pulseaudio` (The good alsa, the bad daemon & the ugly pipewire)

## Installation:

### Check for dependencies and compatibility + Compile rust goodies

You should run the `install` script, mind that it **WON'T**  install anything, we have `leftwm-theme` for that. This script will check if you have all the correct dependencies in order to install this theme.

### NO! I'm too lazy, do it for me! >.<

You can install using the official `leftwm-theme` tool.

`leftwm-theme install "Epitaph"`

**BUT** bear in mind that this won't work as expected since it is not possible to make "post-install hooks" in `leftwm-theme`, you'll have to compile the rust goodies by yourself.

### Manual Installation (If you want the latest git commit)

This theme installation is pretty straightforward:

Extract this repository to `~/.config/leftwm/themes`

- Either rename it as `current` or create a symlink called `current` it to the above folder

- Soft reload with:  <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

If everything is good, this theme should load up quickly if not, please check your dependencies. Feel free
to open requests, make suggestions and improvements, try not to get confused.

## Issues (Not worth using the tabs up there)
- Make a wiki / howto guide for customization
- Add more dmenu scripts
